## How to Compile

### Windows

### Linux

(Nothing Here. may I later will write it?)

## How to Play/Use

You can drag number and operator. **Operator dosn't rebirth! Don't use number rewrite Operators!**

And you connect it like: `1 + 1 = `ï¼Œits automatics spawn a `2` after the equal operator.

Use `E` on you keyboards, you can put a equal operator at you mouse pos.

Use 'W' on you keyboards, you can show the web.
